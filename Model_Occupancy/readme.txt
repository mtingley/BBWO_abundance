The code and data files here accompany the manuscript “An integrated occupancy and home-range model to predict abundance of a wide-ranging, territorial vertebrate” by Morgan W. Tingley, Robert L. Wilkerson, Christine A. Howell, and Rodney B. Siegel.

Any questions should be directed to Morgan Tingley at <morgan.tingley@uconn.edu>

The files in this folder contain the JAGS code, input data (used for covariate centering), and fitted parameter posteriors for the occupancy model (psi) for our case study of Black-backed Woodpeckers. The model fits occupancy probability as a function of numerous environmental covariates. See Appendix S1 and the main text for more specific details.
