The code and data files here accompany the manuscript “An integrated occupancy and home-range model to predict abundance of a wide-ranging, territorial vertebrate” by Morgan W. Tingley, Robert L. Wilkerson, Christine A. Howell, and Rodney B. Siegel.

The files in this folder contain the JAGS code, input data (used for covariate centering), and fitted parameter posteriors for prediction of snag basal area model for our case study of Black-backed Woodpeckers. Snag basal area is a required input layer in order to predict home-range size (D). This model predicts snag basal area as a function of several environmental covariates. See the main text for more specific details.
