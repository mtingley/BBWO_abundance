The code and data files here accompany the manuscript “An integrated occupancy and home-range model to predict abundance of a wide-ranging, territorial vertebrate” by Morgan W. Tingley, Robert L. Wilkerson, Christine A. Howell, and Rodney B. Siegel.

Any questions should be directed to Morgan Tingley at <morgan.tingley@uconn.edu>

The files in this folder contain the JAGS code and fitted parameter posteriors for the home range model (D) for our case study of Black-backed Woodpeckers. The model fits home-range size as a function of snag basal area. See Appendix S1 and the main text for more specific details.
